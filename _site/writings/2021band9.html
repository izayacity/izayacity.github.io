class="c75 doc-content"><p class="c9"><span class="c17">Work and Careers </span></p><p class="c76"><span class="c0">Employers </span><span class="c2">are always seeking ways to enhance </span><span class="c0">their employee&rsquo;s productivity, and &nbsp;subsidizing healthy pursuits </span><span class="c3">may be</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;one way of achieving this</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c2">There are arguments on both &nbsp;sides, however, which we will discuss here. </span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c0">On the one hand, it might be said that if workers are </span><span class="c5">fitter and less stressed</span><span class="c0">, their working &nbsp;time will be more </span><span class="c5">efficient</span><span class="c0">, leading to </span><span class="c5">higher levels of output and service</span><span class="c0">. Furthermore, the &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">work-life balance </span><span class="c0">of the staff will hopefully be improved, because their </span><span class="c5">leisure time will be &nbsp;more fulfilling</span><span class="c0">. This may even be </span><span class="c5">more motivating than </span><span class="c0">pay increments, perks, or financial &nbsp;rewards such as bonuses or incentives which may be hard to attain. Finally, feeling healthier &nbsp;may lead to </span><span class="c5">better job satisfaction </span><span class="c0">which is in itself a motivating factor. </span></p><p class="c67"><span class="c2">Conversely, the problem with </span><span class="c0">such leisure-based subsidies is that </span><span class="c2">their efficacy is virtually &nbsp;impossible to quantify</span><span class="c0">. For example, with </span><span class="c5">target-related </span><span class="c0">payments, employers can at least &nbsp;see whether the objectives are reached or not. It might also be said that, if this budget was &nbsp;spent on(for instance) the job training or day release programs, the employees would &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">achieve better career progression </span><span class="c0">and </span><span class="c5">have better job prospects</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c2">These matters are all &nbsp;easier to measure, especially </span><span class="c0">in performance reviews and appraisals, and may even help to &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">reduce the risk of redundancy </span><span class="c0">if the company restructures, downsizes or outsources its &nbsp;workforce. </span></p><p class="c52"><span class="c2">Overall, it seems that, while health related subsidies are superficially attractive, the lack of &nbsp;measurability is a substantial drawback. </span><span class="c0">Spending funds on ongoing training </span><span class="c2">would appear &nbsp;to be a better use of company or human resources </span><span class="c3">budgets</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c24 c52"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c0">P1 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Employer purpose; </span></p><p class="c63"><span class="c0">- Example work around(Subsidizing healthy pursuits) - Mention both arguments; </span></p><p class="c84"><span class="c0">P2(argument 1) </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- benefit 1; </span></p><p class="c47"><span class="c1">- </span><span class="c0">benefit 2; </span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c1">- </span><span class="c0">Remark; </span></p><p class="c37"><span class="c1">- </span><span class="c0">Extra benefit; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">P3(argument 2) </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- drawback; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- explanation; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- hypothesis of an alternative; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- More benefits of the alternative; </span></p><p class="c48 c86"><span class="c0">P4 </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- argument1 concession; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- drawback; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Alternative summary</span></p><p class="c48 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Education and schooling </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c2">There is a huge range of resources available to </span><span class="c0">the modern teacher, </span><span class="c2">and the right selection is &nbsp;crucial in delivering effective </span><span class="c0">lessons. </span><span class="c2">I agree that there will always be a place for </span><span class="c0">course &nbsp;books in the school curriculum, </span><span class="c2">despite the many benefits of </span><span class="c0">the internet. </span></p><p class="c44"><span class="c0">Firstly, course books(whether conventional or digital) have been developed by </span><span class="c2">pedagogical </span><span class="c0">experts and </span><span class="c5">designed to be incorporated into a subject syllabus</span><span class="c0">, leading to testing &nbsp;procedures such as formal examinations or continuous assessment. This means that they &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">are proven to improve students&rsquo; academic achievement</span><span class="c0">, enhancing their potential for &nbsp;progression to further or higher education. Furthermore, the use of modern course books &nbsp;allows students to </span><span class="c5">coordinate their studies as part of group work</span><span class="c0">, hopefully making their &nbsp;sessions less teacher-led, and more about autonomous learning. This in itself teaches study &nbsp;skills such as independent research and synthesizing sources, rather than old-fashioned &nbsp;rote-learning. This is where the internet, in fact, can play a useful part: to </span><span class="c5">supplement and &nbsp;add to knowledge </span><span class="c0">which the students are assimilating via their course books. However, it is &nbsp;the role of teachers and school management generally to </span><span class="c5">ensure that use of the internet &nbsp;remains a guided learning process</span><span class="c0">, and not an exercise in data-gathering from internet &nbsp;sources which may be unreliable or even misleading. </span></p><p class="c60"><span class="c0">It is true that the internet can be invaluable for adults (for example in distance learning or &nbsp;self-study modules) who are able to discriminate between sources and sift information to &nbsp;marshal their facts. However, this is a mature skill and we should not assume that school &nbsp;age students are ready to do this. </span></p><p class="c83"><span class="c2">Overall, it appears that </span><span class="c5">course books, with their quality and depth of material, are set to &nbsp;remain an integral part of the syllabus</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c8">The internet can be judged a useful supplement to &nbsp;this, if used carefully and under supervision.</span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c56"><span class="c41">P1 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">- List resources and address what&rsquo;s important; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Statement; </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c41">P2 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">- Argument1 of course book, proved; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Argument2, group work; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Put internet here; </span></p><p class="c45"><span class="c0">- Internet&rsquo;s drawback and the responsibilities for teachers and school management; </span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c41">P3 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c0">- Giving condition or special example of the opposite opinion, which does not apply to &nbsp;students; </span></p><p class="c73"><span class="c41">P4 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c0">- Re-address course book; </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">- Position internet as supplement;</span></p><p class="c24 c48"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Children and families </span></p><p class="c28"><span class="c0">Nobody can deny that parental influence is important for children, at least in cases where &nbsp;children live with their parents, foster parents or guardians. </span><span class="c2">However, it is by no means clear &nbsp;that children should spend time exclusively in the family, as we will see. </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c0">On the one hand, it may appear advisable for parents to </span><span class="c5">act as role models and to establish &nbsp;ground rules for behavior </span><span class="c0">by spending as much time as possible with their children. This &nbsp;allows the youngsters to </span><span class="c5">absorb conventions and codes of conduct </span><span class="c0">which they can then &nbsp;follow themselves, hopefully leading to an absence of problems such as bullying, truancy &nbsp;and delinquency later on. Furthermore, </span><span class="c2">being with the family should reduce the risk of &nbsp;children falling victim to crimes such as abduction, or coming under the influence of &nbsp;negative peer pressure. </span></p><p class="c85"><span class="c2">On the other hand, we have to ask whether this is a practical proposition. </span><span class="c0">In a society where &nbsp;many families are dual-income, or where one parent&rsquo;s role as bread-winner means he/she is &nbsp;alway from the family for long periods, </span><span class="c2">it is inevitable that children can not spend all of their &nbsp;time with </span><span class="c0">the family. Child-minding and after-school childcare are often used in these cases, &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">and if managed properly, these can be perfectly viable alternatives. </span><span class="c5">Equally, it seems that &nbsp;children can in some cases learn a considerable amount from their peers in addition to &nbsp;adults, </span><span class="c0">and </span><span class="c5">allowing them to play without direct supervision may be a benefit</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c25"><span class="c2">To conclude, it appears that, while </span><span class="c0">family time is essential for bonding and absorbing &nbsp;patterns of behavior, </span><span class="c2">there are definite advantages when </span><span class="c0">children are outside the family too. &nbsp;</span><span class="c2">This is provided that </span><span class="c0">they are in a safe, well-behaved environment with peers who are &nbsp;themselves reasonably well brought-up.</span></p><p class="c25 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c0">P1 </span></p><p class="c48 c49"><span class="c0">- Address the statement(parental influence); </span></p><p class="c48 c55"><span class="c0">&#8259; Raise the opposite proposition(exclusively); </span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c0">P2 </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c0">&#8259; Statement1(what, who) and method(how)(role model, establishing ground rules, &nbsp;spending time); </span></p><p class="c26"><span class="c0">&#8259; Good influence 1(avoid bullying, truancy and delinquency); </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&#8259; Good influence 2(reduce risk of falling victim, peer pressure); </span></p><p class="c42"><span class="c0">P3 </span></p><p class="c48 c55"><span class="c0">&#8259; Opposite statement; </span></p><p class="c55 c78"><span class="c0">&#8259; The statement does not apply for everyone(dual-income, parent away from the family); &#8259; Alternative solution(child-minding, after-school childcare, peers); P4 </span></p><p class="c55 c58"><span class="c0">&#8259; Conclusion(there are definite advantages); </span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">&#8259; Condition(safe environment, peers well brought-up);</span></p><p class="c22 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c22 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c17">Nature, the environment and &nbsp;energy </span></p><p class="c38"><span class="c0">Water contamination is a serious form of pollution, and one that can be challenging to &nbsp;rectify. </span><span class="c2">There seem to be two main causes involved, and a variety of damaging effects on &nbsp;people and the biosphere, which we will discuss here. </span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c0">Probably the main factor is the issue of emissions from cars, factories and other human &nbsp;activities. These emissions contain damaging pollutant particles which can contaminate &nbsp;rainwater run-off and thus enter the water cycle, by transferring through the water table into &nbsp;aquifers, streams and rivers. </span><span class="c5">Filtration and processing are not really viable options for such &nbsp;large volumes of water, and so the water table remains tainted with these elements over &nbsp;long periods, as we see in Eastern Europe today. </span><span class="c0">In situations where soil erosion and &nbsp;logging have already damaged the local environment, the accumulation can be very serious. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">The other major cause is accidental or deliberate dumping of waste products in places &nbsp;outside of controlled landfills or waste processing centers. </span><span class="c0">Even small amounts of &nbsp;abandoned waste can enter water supplies through the ground, often undetected. </span></p><p class="c33"><span class="c0">The effects on animal life can be severe, especially for species which are already &nbsp;endangered by such threats as poaching, habitat loss and food chain disruption. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Contaminated water can lead to dwindling numbers or even potential extinction, as many &nbsp;indeed happen to the Asian tiger populations. </span><span class="c0">The impact on human society can also be &nbsp;distressing, including the poisoning of drinking water, famine or drought due to lack of safe &nbsp;irrigation, and long-term loss of land as we see, for example, after the Bhopal poisoning &nbsp;catastrophe in India. Such effects tend to have an especially grave impact on the very &nbsp;poorest in society, with the least resources to counter the environmental effect. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">Overall, we see that emissions and dumping are the main origins of the problem, and that &nbsp;the effects on both humans and animals are exacerbated by the existing environmental, &nbsp;criminal or social problems.</span></p><p class="c21 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c0">P1 </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Impact; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">P2 </span></p><p class="c18"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">factor1(emissions from cars, factories, human activities); </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Pollutant particles contaminate and enter the water cycle; </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Large amount, filtration and processing do not work, so remain; </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Situations where soil erosion and logging damaged, accumulation; </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Dumping outside landfills or waste processing centers; </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Even small, undetected; </span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c0">P3 </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Animal life severe, especially for endangered; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Contaminated water dwindling numbers; </span></p><p class="c40"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Human health drinking, famine or drought, loss of land; </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Poorest; </span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c0">P4 </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Emissions and dumping; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Exacerbated;</span></p><p class="c27 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c24 c27"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Culture, art and traditions </span></p><p class="c80"><span class="c2">Most people would agree that preserving connections with our past is an admirable &nbsp;objective, especially as the world evolves so rapidly. I feel that traditional costumes are one &nbsp;part of doing this, but they are by no means the most important, as we shall see. </span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c2">Admittedly, historic dress plays a key role in </span><span class="c0">social events such as religious rituals or military &nbsp;parades, and these events are helpful in transmitting social memes such as public duty and &nbsp;self-sacrifice. Traditional costumes also remind us of the origins of cultural traditions and &nbsp;mythologies, for instance the historic Swiss national dress which evokes their medieval &nbsp;independence. </span></p><p class="c39"><span class="c2">However, it must be said that </span><span class="c0">costumes are an accessory in these situations, and </span><span class="c2">do not &nbsp;appear to constitute the central message. </span><span class="c0">It is the ceremonies themselves which convey the &nbsp;cultural norms that help to maintain the fabric of society. In this sense, the costumes are of &nbsp;secondary importance. Furthermore, it seems that there are in fact much more powerful &nbsp;ways in which culture is </span><span class="c2">conserved and handed down </span><span class="c0">between the generations. </span><span class="c5">Most &nbsp;countries have a rich heritage of legends and folklore about the birth and development of &nbsp;their nation, some of which are mythological and some being grounded in truth (as we see in &nbsp;the English stories about Robin Hood or George and the Dragon, for example). </span><span class="c0">These stories &nbsp;are a cultural inheritance which embodies important symbols and concepts far more &nbsp;effectively than dress. </span></p><p class="c89"><span class="c5">Similarly, we must remember the significance of art and music in passing on our traditions, &nbsp;in forms ranging from fine art to handicrafts, and from opera to traditional shanties and &nbsp;dirges. The presence of visual or linguistic messages in these media make them more &nbsp;effective than costumes, which convey no language. </span></p><p class="c32"><span class="c2">Overall, we must recognize and welcome the use of traditional dress in helping to maintain &nbsp;our culture. However, the forms of story, art and music would appear to be the driving forces &nbsp;in this invaluable process.</span></p><p class="c32 c24"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c31"><span class="c0">P1 </span></p><p class="c34"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Purpose statement(preserving connections with our past); </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Costume positioning; </span></p><p class="c72"><span class="c0">P2 </span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Admittedly(religious ritual, military parade); </span><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Origin of cultural traditions and mythologies; P3 </span></p><p class="c49 c57"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Ceremonies, secondary; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">More effective ways; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Explanation; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Art and music, in forms; </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">P4 </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">Recognize and welcome; </span></p><p class="c27"><span class="c1">&#8259; </span><span class="c0">But story, art and music are the driving forces;</span></p><p class="c27 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c27 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Healthcare, health and sport </span></p><p class="c77"><span class="c0">Children appear to enjoy playing video games, and while there are undoubted benefits, &nbsp;various negative effects stem from this too. Let us consider the main issues, and then &nbsp;outline possible remedies. </span></p><p class="c66"><span class="c5">Perhaps the major physical problem is the sedentary lifestyle which these games &nbsp;encourage, meaning that youngsters may incline to obesity or inadequate development. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Added to this is the strain on eyesight resulting from excessive use of screens and consoles, &nbsp;meaning that children may suffer symptoms of poor vision. </span><span class="c2">There are also concerns about &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">impairment of reflexes due to the repetitive nature of the hand muscles when playing these &nbsp;games, and about the poor diet of convenience food which often accompanies this lifestyle. </span></p><p class="c29"><span class="c0">The most alarming psychological impact of such activities is possibly the risk of addiction, &nbsp;meaning that children become obsessed with the games and are unable to socialize with &nbsp;family or peers. </span><span class="c5">This undermines their interpersonal skills and makes them underperform &nbsp;both academically and socially. </span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c5">Turning to possible solutions, perhaps the immediate step would be to promote a more &nbsp;active lifestyle through exercise regimes or sports programs which would help to detoxify &nbsp;the lifestyles of children affected. </span><span class="c0">This could be done through sponsorship of sports, or &nbsp;participation in competitive events such as races or matches, hopefully ameliorating the &nbsp;physical effects of excessive games use. </span><span class="c5">Potential remedies for the danger of mental &nbsp;addiction may be, firstly, an initiative to raise awareness of the risks of the situation, for &nbsp;example through health warnings on games packaging or through high-profile &nbsp;spokespersons spreading such a message. </span><span class="c0">For example, if sports champions or figureheads &nbsp;speak out about these dangers, the message may well get through to children. </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c2">To sum up, the risks posed by excessive gaming are connected to </span><span class="c0">an unhealthy lifestyle and &nbsp;the possibility of dependency on the activity. </span><span class="c2">Possible answers might involve stronger &nbsp;education about the dangers and the health benefits of more active pursuits.</span></p><p class="c65 c24"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c24 c65"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Global challenges </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c0">Youth unemployment </span><span class="c2">is certainly a worrying challenge for most countries, especially at a &nbsp;time of economic instability and social unrest. However, to say that this is the largest issue is &nbsp;to overlook a range of equally pressing matters, as we will discuss now. </span></p><p class="c35"><span class="c0">Admittedly, joblessness </span><span class="c2">can undermine a young person&rsquo;s economic prospects and &nbsp;consequent social mobility</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c2">Nevertheless, this issue can be ameliorated by coordinated &nbsp;action between the state and the private sector, as we have seen, for instance, in </span><span class="c0">Canada &nbsp;recently. </span><span class="c2">When this is realized, we can see that other concerns are at least as serious. </span></p><p class="c61"><span class="c2">Foremost among these is perhaps the issue of </span><span class="c5">age demographics</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c5">whereby young people &nbsp;bear the burden for an increasingly elderly population with high longevity</span><span class="c0">. This means that &nbsp;young people will pay higher taxes and work longer hours, possibly forcing them to migrate &nbsp;to countries where this pressure is lower. The effect will encourage young ambitious people &nbsp;to leave their countries altogether, </span><span class="c2">exacerbating the problem for those remaining</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c43"><span class="c0">Furthermore, we must remember that </span><span class="c2">a substantial proportion of </span><span class="c0">young people globally face &nbsp;existential threats such as famine, drought or outbreaks of disease. These problems are &nbsp;often caused by (or are compounded by) civil war, political instability or the corruption of &nbsp;people in power locally. Such risks are a danger to their safety in addition to their livelihood, &nbsp;and so would appear to be far more serious than unemployment. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">To conclude, it seems logical to accept that joblessness is a major challenge for young &nbsp;people. However, persistent trends in demographics among developed countries and the &nbsp;presence of physical dangers in developing countries should be regarded as at least as &nbsp;severe.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Cities and infrastructure </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">Transport is an essential part of urban life, and lengthy journeys are frustrating and &nbsp;expensive for those concerned. </span><span class="c2">There appear to be two main causes of this, and several &nbsp;possible solutions, as we will explain here. </span></p><p class="c82"><span class="c5">Perhaps the main cause is the lack of investment or funding for infrastructure in the form of &nbsp;high-capacity public transport and increased road space for private vehicles. </span><span class="c0">This means &nbsp;that too many vehicles use the existing network, and congestion is </span><span class="c2">inevitable</span><span class="c0">. We see this in &nbsp;most large cities globally, such as London or Tokyo. </span><span class="c5">Many conurbations also lack finance for &nbsp;transport hubs, such as integrated road and rail facilities which could connect public and &nbsp;private transport, thus reducing bottlenecks. </span><span class="c53">A further cause seems to be the problem of &nbsp;overcrowding in cities, whereby people migrate from the hinterland and settle in urban &nbsp;areas, putting strain on amenities, housing and above all on transport capacity. </span><span class="c2">This means &nbsp;that an already stretched system is often pushed to a critical threshold</span><span class="c0">, causing &nbsp;cancellations and breakdowns in the technology used, especially in situations of urban &nbsp;sprawl such as in Lain America. </span></p><p class="c87"><span class="c0">Regarding potential solutions, probably the main </span><span class="c2">remedy </span><span class="c0">would be to encourage investment &nbsp;in better infrastructure, for example through subsidies or public-private partnerships as was &nbsp;tried successfully in Germany during the 1990&rsquo;s. This improves the network and fosters a &nbsp;sense of civic pride, to everyone&rsquo;s benefit. </span><span class="c2">Another solution may be to use tax incentives to &nbsp;allow more </span><span class="c0">home working, </span><span class="c5">so that there is less need to commute from the suburbs to the &nbsp;inner city for work</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c2">A final response might be the development of more flexible patterns of &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">transport, such as communal car-pooling, which would reduce reliance on existing systems &nbsp;and vehicles. </span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c0">In conclusion, it seems that outdated infrastructure and overcrowding are the key factors &nbsp;behind our transport frustrations. </span><span class="c2">Possible solutions would involve better funding, and also &nbsp;innovations in ways of working and traveling to reduce the burden on the system.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Countryside and agriculture </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">There can be few choices in life more important than where to settle as a family, and the &nbsp;question of an urban or rural location is complex. There are strong arguments for and &nbsp;against living in the countryside, as we will discuss now. </span></p><p class="c74"><span class="c0">On the one hand, it might be said that the countryside is rather a backwater, with fewer &nbsp;cultural amenities than a city in the form of museums, theaters and even sporting events. &nbsp;This may mean that families become isolated, especially as rural depopulation leaves fewer &nbsp;country dwellers in the area. Added to this is the scarcity of schools and colleges, meaning &nbsp;that children may need to travel long distances for their education. Finally, career options &nbsp;may be more limited in the countryside for both parents and children, </span><span class="c5">resulting in rural &nbsp;unemployment and long-term rural poverty in the worst cases</span><span class="c0">. </span></p><p class="c36"><span class="c2">Conversely, </span><span class="c0">life in the countryside </span><span class="c19">has rewards which go beyond material considerations</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;For example, the abundance of natural resources such as land, wildlife forestry and water &nbsp;bodies means that </span><span class="c5">a comparatively simple life can be lived at a subsistence level</span><span class="c0">. Many &nbsp;country residents are self-sufficient small holds in this sense, safeguarding them from the &nbsp;changes in the wider economy which can afflict city dwellers. If the parents are farmers, &nbsp;children learn the importance of animal husbandry, methods of farming such as crop &nbsp;rotation and irrigation, generally may become more in tune with the natural world as a result. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Finally, as technology enables children to undertake distance learning or remote viewing of &nbsp;cultural attractions such as museums, they should be less isolated from their cultural &nbsp;heritage. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c0">Overall, it seems to me that quality of life in the countryside today is indeed quite high, with &nbsp;its advantages of resources, self-sufficiency and environmental awareness. This is especially &nbsp;true now that communications are reducing the risk of isolation in such far-flung &nbsp;communities.</span></p><p class="c21 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c21 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c17">Government and the authorities </span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">The need for effective, trustworthy police officers is paramount in society today, especially &nbsp;as criminals become more devious and creative. Regarding whether police should be locally &nbsp;hired, there is a case to be made on both sides of the debate. </span></p><p class="c68"><span class="c0">Those who support local recruitment of officers point to the need for the police to &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">understand the minutiae of the local community</span><span class="c0">. For example, a community may have &nbsp;certain frictions or a history of a specific grievance, whether religious, political or otherwise. &nbsp;In such situations, the argument goes, the police need to show sensitivity, and also be able &nbsp;to anticipate the kinds of crimes that may be committed. Furthermore, </span><span class="c5">local officers may &nbsp;find it easier to gain informants in the community</span><span class="c0">, leading to stronger evidence at trials, &nbsp;higher conviction rates and a deterrent to crime through sentencing, imprisonment, fines or &nbsp;community service leading to rehabilitation of the offender. </span></p><p class="c50"><span class="c0">On the other hand, it seems likely that </span><span class="c5">officers from the community may in fact share some &nbsp;of the tendencies of the people they grew up with</span><span class="c0">. For example, in countries such as &nbsp;Mexico, we see a high incidence of corruption among the local business and government &nbsp;community which is </span><span class="c62">equaled</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by bribery among the police. A second objection is that </span><span class="c5">local &nbsp;sensitivity may lead to the police failing to enforce laws fully, and effectively making &nbsp;exceptions for some offenders, which is inequitable towards law-abiding citizens</span><span class="c0">. Finally, we &nbsp;must remember that </span><span class="c5">police officers should have transferable skills, such as lateral thinking &nbsp;and investigative ability</span><span class="c0">, which should transcend their background or the environment they &nbsp;are working in. </span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c0">Overall, it seems to me that local knowledge </span><span class="c2">is not absolutely essential </span><span class="c0">for the police, whose &nbsp;skills should be effective in any context. Indeed, I agree with those who say that the risks of &nbsp;local recruitment outweigh the benefits, because of the danger of corruption and over familiarity with potential offenders.</span></p><p class="c51 c24"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
