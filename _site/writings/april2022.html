This essay is going to discuss what the causes of this trend are as well as what the impacts on those nations are. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c8">Regarding the causes, there are two main reasons that contribute to the development of this style. Firstly,</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;people do not have time to communicate with others, such as the workers are extremely busy at work and tired post their shift. </span><span class="c3 c8">Consequently</span><span class="c3 c4">, they really want to relax and be lonely without playing with others. </span><span class="c3 c17">Additionally,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;each person in this modern society has their own smart device, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops. They tend to focus on their personal devices even when meeting other people. 50 percent of young people will tend to live individually if they usually use a smartphone while meeting friends, according to the research from Harvard University.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c10 c3">The trend will bring some negative impacts on the society of nations which are experiencing this.</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;Firstly, the family connection will be </span><span class="c3 c17">loosening</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;because of this lifestyle. For example, a son or a daughter who did not talk to their parents for a while because of living far from their parents will lose connection easily. </span><span class="c3 c8">Furthermore,</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;people who do not want to be exposed to society will get stress easier than the opposite ones. As a result, those ones tend to find death because they feel stressed and they do not know which ones they should share feelings with. </span><span class="c3 c8">According to recent research,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;30% of the young generation in Korea is feeling stressed and they used to think about death. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c29 c18">In conclusion, having heavy workloads and abusing smart devices are the reasons that lead to the growth of living in small family groups in this modern world. This not only negatively affects the connection between parents and children, but it also impacts on the mental health of the young generation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h5 class="c19" id="h.wd7gpfchpj5d"><span class="c12">2. Some people think that with the increasing use of mobile phones and computers, people lose the ability to communicate face to face.</span></h5><p class="c5"><span class="c1">To what extent do you agree or disagree?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c23 c3"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://writing9.com/text/6183b4f4ed99dc0019405e60-some-people-think-that-with-the-increasing-use-of-mobile&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1734283921479783&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oILIvHbRgrSPMK01Uve2Q">https://writing9.com/text/6183b4f4ed99dc0019405e60-some-people-think-that-with-the-increasing-use-of-mobile</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c10 c3">Recent years have seen a dramatic boom in smartphone and PC use, contributing to the worry that the ability to make facial contact with others has been lost.</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c15">In my view,</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;the face to face talking skills are not </span><span class="c10 c3">undermined</span><span class="c3 c4">, as </span><span class="c25 c3 c16">there is still a range of situations where physical conversations cannot be replaced by online ones. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c15">To begin with, it is considerably more efficient to accomplish tasks in the workplace via facial conversations than communicate just online.</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c10">Misunderstandings probably tend to occur by literally talking because the tone of the speaker is unknown. </span><span class="c3 c8">Even if online conferencing is available, it is not as convenient as arranging a meeting physically due to the possibility of not being able to catch up on the internet.</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;For instance, though the zoom app, an application that helps you to set up online meetings both through cellphones and laptops, is extremely popular all over the world </span><span class="c10 c3">especially with the pandemic going on</span><span class="c2">, managers still make huge efforts to urge their staff to return to the office buildings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">In addition, </span><span class="c3 c18 c27">informal communications with friends and families are so frequent and easy that they hardly could give way to chatting on the internet.</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c8">Friends and families are those people whom you live with or meet nearly every day. Although sometimes you may be apart, for example, having a business journey, the getting-together time constitutes the majority. </span><span class="c3 c4">Therefore, having a video talk with them on mobile phone applications or on computer software </span><span class="c3 c8">may relieve the miss to them, it is a tiny part generally</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">In conclusion, </span><span class="c3 c18 c29">it is not necessary to be anxious that</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;people cannot communicate with others </span><span class="c3 c18 c27">ficially</span><span class="c3 c4">, because online talking </span><span class="c3 c8">only composes an insignificant piece of people&#39;s whole lives</span><span class="c3 c4">. Thus, the computer and cellphone impossibly could make people unable to make face to face conversations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h5 class="c19" id="h.l50vmlhst5jo"><span class="c12">3. Some countries achieve international success by building specialized facilities to train top athletes instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use.</span></h5><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Do you think it is a positive or negative development&#65311;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c23 c3"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ieltspracticeonline.com/ielts-writing-task-2-sports-facilities/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1734283921481788&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vg8oJXlifrT4hHKkoF2Xs">https://ieltspracticeonline.com/ielts-writing-task-2-sports-facilities/</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c7">Heavy investment in sports facilities aimed at professional athletes </span><span class="c3 c26 c7">is common</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;in countries that want to compete in international events. </span><span class="c3 c26 c7">This is a positive development for</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;national pride </span><span class="c25 c3 c21 c7">but negative on the whole as it takes funding away from the average citizen.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c7 c24">Proponents of this practice would argue that</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;it brings the nation together. </span><span class="c3 c14 c7">The best examples of this relate to</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;international competitions like the summer and winter Olympics. China and the United States have famously invested millions in building sports facilities for prospective Olympians and </span><span class="c3 c9 c7">the results in terms of medals justify the expenditure</span><span class="c3 c7">. The wider implications for national unity come from an entire country watching the telecasts and rooting together. </span><span class="c3 c14 c7">Divisive domestic disputes are temporarily forgotten as everyone focuses on the progress of their country.</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c25 c3 c7 c28">Much of this would be impossible without specialized sports facilities for the best competitors.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c7">However, these facilities </span><span class="c3 c14 c7">benefit a selected few over the majority</span><span class="c3 c7">. Funding for such facilities is a limited part of a federal budget that must cover essential areas like health, education, and the military. </span><span class="c3 c14 c7">Any money diverted towards preparing world-class athletes for international competitions is to some extent a waste as it cuts into the budget for facilities for average people.</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c21 c7">For example, many inner city youths in poorer neighborhoods lack access to parks and such facilities and this has been identified as one of the factors that allows for poverty to be inherited over generations.</span><span class="c3 c7 c25">&nbsp;Direct the funding away from these expensive gyms for top athletes and it would be possible to build many more facilities that serve a much wider and underserved segment of the population.</span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c3 c7 c9">In conclusion, despite the less tangible benefits to national cohesiveness,</span><span class="c3 c7">&nbsp;this is a negative on level as it favors a talented minority. </span><span class="c25 c3 c14 c7">More resources should be allocated towards facilities for those in greater need.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c23 c3"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://writing9.com/text/5ff1645b2f480d00117acdac-some-countries-achieve-international-success-by-building-specialized-facilities-to&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1734283921483152&amp;usg=AOvVaw0U4UgFBJ8ylvGtF5zolnIN">https://writing9.com/text/5ff1645b2f480d00117acdac-some-countries-achieve-international-success-by-building-specialized-facilities-to</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c14">Numerous nations are becoming successful</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;at the international platform by providing training to their best athletes instead of working on improving facilities for everybody. I am of the opinion that </span><span class="c1 c21">it has many drawbacks and it will be justified in the following paragraphs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c6">First and foremost,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;many nations are nowadays focussing on building facilities to train a few athletes for international competitions. Therefore, people who have inborn talents can only reach the top of the list and can get further training for the bigger events. </span><span class="c3 c14">As a result, only a few will be rewarded with the training and others who could have performed better with some guidance will not be able to do so.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c6">And they will feel devastated and dejected. Moreover, they will lose hope and may start looking for another option for living. For instance, only 11 players can play in an international team of any country and only 16 get an opportunity to be selected in a team. These numbers are too low to motivate other players to work hard on their own to vie for the national team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">In addition to that, </span><span class="c3 c14">if facilities at ground level are not improved then soon the craze for sports will be lost and very few people would try to play in the national team.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c21">This reduction in passion will ultimately affect the quality of the players at the national level and hence this will hamper their success at international platforms.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c11">To exemplify,</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;in a developing country such as India, approximately 80% of children play some games and this reduces to 10% when they </span><span class="c3 c26">cross adolescents</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and hardly 1% amongst them try to pursue their career in sports. It is just because of </span><span class="c3 c20">the negligence of</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;sports facilities and training </span><span class="c3 c14">at ground level</span><span class="c1">; they start losing their interest in sports.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">To conclude, although many nations have tasted success in international competitions by just focussing on their best athletes, </span><span class="c3 c24">this trend is temporary</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;People will start losing their interest in games if they do not get attention from governments in terms of facilities and soon it will </span><span class="c3 c21">have a huge negative impact on</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the talent of athletes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h5 class="c19" id="h.9y62rx51sohg"><span class="c12">4. Some people believe that the main benefit of international cooperation is in the environment, others maintain that the major profit is the development of world business.</span></h5><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c23 c3"><a class="c22" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://writing9.com/text/6139d2972b4348001866e461-some-people-believe-that-the-main-benefit-of-international-cooperation&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1734283921485189&amp;usg=AOvVaw0f4ehRcxl0gV_CxTkEDN_g">https://writing9.com/text/6139d2972b4348001866e461-some-people-believe-that-the-main-benefit-of-international-cooperation</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">Some people consider that global cooperation is more profitable for trade and corporations, while others believe that it has the main benefits to the environment. In my view, I hold the opinion that &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c21 c18">globalization has much more positive effects on business than that on the environment</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">On the one hand, with the expansion of world manufactures that cause many kinds of pollution, the impacts to the natural environment are unavoidable. </span><span class="c3 c14 c18">Due to the construction of factories, the damages to the ecosystem such as deforestation and </span><span class="c3 c16">green gas emission</span><span class="c3 c14 c18">&nbsp;are heavily rising.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;For example, many developed countries&#39; costume manufacturers build their factories in Third World nations that have fragile ecosystems. As a consequence, the forests are disappearing; the water resources such as freshwater lakes and rivers are reducing; the glaciers are retreating year by year due to &nbsp;climate change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">On the other hand, the process of globalization has helped many businesses to develop their scale of trade. Firstly, owing to international cooperation, </span><span class="c3 c21 c18">the commercial fields have had a larger scale of access to labor and new markets in diverse areas, along with providing people from all over the world with more chances for employment.</span><span class="c3 c4">&nbsp;Secondly, </span><span class="c3 c18 c27">increased globalization promotes the spread of knowledge, technology and talents</span><span class="c3 c4">. For instance, the mobile phone industries in China have expanded their market, factories and techniques globally, with the cognition of international trade and communication. As for the profits, Chinese mobile phone companies have grown their businesses overseas, especially in poor regions of developing countries, therefore helping them to develop their economy </span><span class="c25 c3 c14 c18">while the manufacturers could have lower cost of production.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">In conclusion, the increase of international relationships absolutely helped the growth of commercial organizations. However, the surroundings are damaged seriously by modern industries at the same position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><h5 class="c19" id="h.2j2skfytru9n"><span class="c12">5.

Some people have the fear of getting old while others think it is not a serious problem in this modern world. In my opinion, I agree with the latter one, and I will analyze both ideas in this essay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">On the one hand, it is obvious that older groups in this society have many inconvenient aspects in their daily lives. Firstly, </span><span class="c3 c14 c18">the physical abilities of old people have an extreme decline</span><span class="c2">, such as eyesight, hearing, and daily movement. The degradation of the physical body also causes many kinds of diseases, therefore their living standard would be unsatisfied due to the unavoidable medical problems. Secondly, because the speed of reaction and body function has decreased largely, older people can not enjoy many sports and games as well as their younger period, especially the extreme sports such as skydiving and skateboarding, even swimming and jogging. In such a situation, older groups have less enjoyment than younger ones.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3 c4">On the other hand, the health care systems and technological facilities are advanced significantly compared with decades ago. For example, the life span of human beings is longer than that in the past, due to </span><span class="c3 c14 c18">the construction of hospital infrastructures and health-related welfare systems</span><span class="c2">. Old populations can get more consideration from social charities and governments. Furthermore, modern technology is getting more and more intelligent, along with the invention of artificial intelligence, such as health care robots that can help aging populations overcome inconvenience and loneliness in their life. Therefore, there are plenty of expectations in modern society for helping aging groups to live more joyfully in the future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c25 c3 c18 c6">To conclude, although aging is an inevitable factor in an individual&#39;s life, with the progress of technology and well-being facilities, the aging public will live easier and more conveniently than ever before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
