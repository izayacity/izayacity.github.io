This essay will </span><span class="c0 c7">examine the underlying causes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of this trend and </span><span class="c0 c2">evaluate its broader implications for society</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0 c7">Two primary factors contribute to the rise of this phenomenon.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Firstly, </span><span class="c0 c5">modern work environments</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c9">demand extensive time and effort</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">leaving individuals with</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;little energy or </span><span class="c0 c20">inclination for social interaction</span><span class="c0">. For instance, many workers, </span><span class="c0 c5">overwhelmed by</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their professional responsibilities, often </span><span class="c0 c9">seek solitude to recuperate</span><span class="c0">. Secondly, </span><span class="c0 c7">the proliferation of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c10">smart devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c5">has transformed the nature of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c2">human interactions</span><span class="c0">. These devices have become </span><span class="c0 c9">ubiquitous</span><span class="c0">, often </span><span class="c0 c7">diverting attention from face-to-face communication</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c2">A Harvard University study revealed that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;50% of young adults who frequently use smartphones </span><span class="c0 c7">during social gatherings</span><span class="c0 c10">&nbsp;are more likely to</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;prefer living alone.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0 c5">This shift towards individual living</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has several </span><span class="c0 c9">adverse societal repercussions</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c7">One significant impact is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c10">the erosion of familial bonds</span><span class="c0">. For example, children </span><span class="c0 c19">living apart from</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their parents may gradually lose meaningful connections </span><span class="c0 c5">due to infrequent communication</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c9">Additionally, </span><span class="c0 c10">prolonged isolation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can </span><span class="c0 c7">exacerbate mental health challenges</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c9">Individuals who withdraw from societal interactions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;often </span><span class="c0 c10">experience heightened stress levels</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c5">lack emotional support systems</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c7">Alarmingly,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c9">recent research indicates that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;30% of young people in South Korea have </span><span class="c0 c10">experienced severe stress</span><span class="c0">, with many </span><span class="c0 c5">contemplating self-harm</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c7">as a result of social isolation</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">In conclusion, </span><span class="c0 c9">the increasing prevalence of heavy workloads</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">the over-reliance on smart devices</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are </span><span class="c0 c5">key drivers of the trend toward individual living</span><span class="c0">. This lifestyle not only </span><span class="c0 c10">undermines familial relationships</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but also</span><span class="c0 c9">&nbsp;poses significant risks to the mental well-being of younger generations</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c5">Addressing these challenges</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c10">requires a concerted effort to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c7">balance technological integration with meaningful human connection</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h5 class="c23 c27" id="h.vqf2sax4c7o8"><span class="c15"></span></h5><h5 class="c8" id="h.wa6742xfulz7"><span class="c15">2. Some people think that with the increasing use of mobile phones and computers, people lose the ability to communicate face to face. </span></h5><p class="c16"><span class="c0 c4">To what extent do you agree or disagree?</span></p><p class="c16 c23"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0 c19">Recent years have witnessed a dramatic surge in the use of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;smartphones and personal computers, </span><span class="c0 c5">raising concerns that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;these technologies might </span><span class="c0 c7">diminish</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;people&#39;s ability to communicate face-to-face. In my opinion, </span><span class="c0 c10">while technology has transformed communication</span><span class="c0">, it </span><span class="c0 c5">has not significantly eroded the skills required for in-person interactions</span><span class="c0">, as physical conversations </span><span class="c0 c9">remain indispensable in various contexts</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">Firstly, face-to-face communication is often more effective and efficient </span><span class="c0 c9">in professional settings compared to digital alternatives</span><span class="c0">. Misunderstandings </span><span class="c0 c7">are more likely to occur in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;online conversations </span><span class="c0 c7">due to the lack of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;vocal tone, body language, and immediate clarification. Although online conferencing platforms, such as Zoom, </span><span class="c0 c5">gained immense popularity during the pandemic</span><span class="c0">, they cannot </span><span class="c0 c9">fully replicate the nuances</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of in-person meetings. Additionally, </span><span class="c0 c10">connectivity issues or technical glitches</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;often </span><span class="c0 c7">hinder</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;smooth interactions. For instance, despite </span><span class="c0 c5">the widespread use of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;online meeting applications, many managers emphasize the importance of returning to office-based interactions to </span><span class="c0 c9">foster collaboration</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;and ensure clear communication.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">Secondly, informal communication with family and friends </span><span class="c0 c10">remains predominantly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;face-to-face, </span><span class="c0 c5">underscoring the enduring value of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;physical interactions. Friends and family members are typically those with whom individuals spend the majority of their time. </span><span class="c0 c9">While technology facilitates communication during periods of physical separation</span><span class="c0">, such as business trips or long-distance relationships, these virtual interactions are often </span><span class="c0 c10">supplementary</span><span class="c0">. The emotional connection and depth </span><span class="c0 c14">achieved through physical presence</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are </span><span class="c0 c9">irreplaceable</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c6">highlighting the limitations of technology in fulfilling social and emotional needs</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">In conclusion, the increasing use of mobile phones and computers has not </span><span class="c0 c10">rendered people incapable of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;face-to-face communication.

Some countries achieve international success by building specialized facilities to train top athletes instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use.</span></h5><p class="c16"><span class="c4 c0">Do you think it is a positive or negative development?</span></p><p class="c16 c23"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">The strategy of </span><span class="c0 c7">prioritizing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;specialized sports facilities for elite athletes has </span><span class="c0 c9">propelled many nations to international acclaim</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c5">While this approach offers short-term advantages, such as</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c20">enhancing national prestige</span><span class="c0">, I </span><span class="c0 c25">contend</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that </span><span class="c0 c19">its long-term consequences</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are </span><span class="c0 c20">predominantly detrimental</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;due to its </span><span class="c0 c5">exclusivity and neglect of grassroots sports development</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0 c9">One compelling argument against this practice is its exclusivity</span><span class="c0">, which </span><span class="c0 c7">marginalizes the majority of the population</span><span class="c0">. Specialized facilities </span><span class="c0 c10">cater to a select group of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;elite athletes, </span><span class="c0 c5">leaving ordinary citizens with inadequate access to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sports infrastructure. For instance, in many urban centers, underprivileged communities often lack basic </span><span class="c0 c7">recreational spaces</span><span class="c0">. This </span><span class="c0 c10">disparity</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;not only </span><span class="c0 c9">hinders physical well-being</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;but also </span><span class="c0 c24">stifles</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;potential talent. </span><span class="c0 c9">A more inclusive allocation of resources</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;could </span><span class="c0 c14">democratize access to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sports, </span><span class="c0 c10">fostering both health and talent development</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c5">across socio-economic strata</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">Another significant </span><span class="c0 c9">drawback</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is the </span><span class="c0 c14">decline in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grassroots sports participation. Without robust facilities </span><span class="c0 c10">at the community level</span><span class="c0">, fewer individuals are likely to </span><span class="c0 c5">engage in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sports, </span><span class="c0 c7">leading to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a </span><span class="c0 c9">diminished talent pool</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for national teams. For example, in countries like India, </span><span class="c0 c5">a substantial proportion of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;children engage in sports during early childhood. However, as they grow older, inadequate facilities and limited support often </span><span class="c0 c9">deter continued participation</span><span class="c0">. By </span><span class="c0 c7">redirecting resources to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grassroots programs, governments could sustain interest and </span><span class="c0 c10">cultivate a broader base of</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;skilled athletes, ensuring long-term success on the international stage.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">In summary, while </span><span class="c0 c9">the establishment of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;elite sports facilities </span><span class="c0 c5">may yield immediate international success</span><span class="c0">, it does so </span><span class="c0 c7">at the expense of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c10">widespread participation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c9">equitable development</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c4 c0 c5">To balance national pride with sustainable growth, governments should prioritize investments in inclusive sports infrastructure that benefits all citizens.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><h5 class="c8" id="h.2jeq42t519sb"><span class="c15">4. Some people believe that the main benefit of international cooperation is in the environment, others maintain that the major profit is the development of world business.</span></h5><p class="c16"><span class="c4 c0">Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</span></p><p class="c16 c23"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">International cooperation </span><span class="c0 c5">plays an indispensable role in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c20">addressing global challenges</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">with some asserting that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c22">its foremost benefit lies in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;environmental conservation, </span><span class="c0 c5">while others contend that it primarily fosters the growth of global commerce</span><span class="c0">. In my opinion, although </span><span class="c0 c22">collaborative efforts have significantly advanced environmental initiatives</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c11">the broader and more enduring impact of international cooperation</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is </span><span class="c0 c7">evident in the sphere of global business</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">On the one hand, international cooperation has been </span><span class="c0 c5">pivotal in combating environmental degradation</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c22">By fostering joint commitments</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">nations have addressed critical issues such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution on a global scale</span><span class="c0">. For instance, </span><span class="c0 c11">landmark agreements like the Paris Climate Accord</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c5">exemplify</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;how </span><span class="c0 c13">unified action can promote sustainable practices</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c7">mitigate environmental harm</span><span class="c0">. However, </span><span class="c0 c11">the rapid industrialization accompanying globalization</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;often undermines these efforts. Many </span><span class="c0 c13">multinational corporations</span><span class="c0">, particularly those </span><span class="c0 c5">based in developed economies</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">relocate production to developing nations</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c22">exacerbating deforestation and pollution in vulnerable ecosystems</span><span class="c0">. Thus, while environmental collaboration </span><span class="c0 c11">yields commendable progress</span><span class="c0">, it </span><span class="c0 c5">faces significant counterforces from unchecked industrial expansion</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">On the other hand, the benefits of international cooperation </span><span class="c0 c7">in advancing global commerce</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are </span><span class="c0 c22">both profound and multifaceted</span><span class="c0">. First, globalization facilitates access to </span><span class="c0 c5">expansive markets, diverse talent pools, and cost-effective production opportunities</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c11">fostering unprecedented economic growth</span><span class="c0">. For example, international trade agreements and strategic partnerships have enabled industries to </span><span class="c0 c3">scale operations and enhance competitiveness</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c17">A case in point</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is China&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0 c5">burgeoning</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mobile phone industry, which has </span><span class="c0 c18">capitalized on</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;international collaboration to </span><span class="c0 c22">expand market reach</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c7">acquire cutting-edge technologies</span><span class="c0">, and </span><span class="c0 c5">streamline production processes</span><span class="c0">. Furthermore, by establishing production hubs in emerging economies, these companies have </span><span class="c0 c10">bolstered local development</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;through job creation and infrastructure investment. </span><span class="c0 c13">This interplay of mutual benefit</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c7">underscores the transformative potential</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;of international cooperation in global commerce.</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c0">In conclusion, while international cooperation has </span><span class="c0 c5">yielded notable achievements</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in addressing environmental challenges, </span><span class="c0 c11">its most profound and enduring contributions lie in the realm of global business</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c0 c22">The capacity to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c7">drive economic growth</span><span class="c0">, innovation, and cross-border collaboration </span><span class="c0 c5">solidifies its role as a cornerstone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of </span><span class="c0 c13">a prosperous and interconnected global economy</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><h5 class="c26" id="h.ehn3m4eumt0y"><span class="c15">5.

As people age, they typically experience </span><span class="c0 c18">a deterioration in mobility, vision, and other physical functions</span><span class="c0">, which can </span><span class="c0 c3">lead to greater dependence on others</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0 c22">diminished quality of life</span><span class="c0">. This decline often results in restricted participation in activities that once brought joy and fulfillment. For instance, older individuals may </span><span class="c0 c6">forgo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hobbies such as jogging or swimming due to </span><span class="c0">reduced stamina or chronic conditions</span><span class="c4 c0">. These limitations not only affect their physical well-being but also contribute to feelings of isolation and frustration, underscoring the challenges of aging.</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">On the other hand, modern society has </span><span class="c0 c3">made remarkable strides in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c6">creating an environment where aging is less daunting</span><span class="c0">. Advances in healthcare, such as </span><span class="c0 c22">preventive medicine and improved treatment options</span><span class="c0">, have significantly increased life expectancy and enhanced the overall well-being of older populations. For example, </span><span class="c0 c3">artificial intelligence-powered devices</span><span class="c0">, such as </span><span class="c0 c11">health-monitoring systems</span><span class="c0">, now assist </span><span class="c0 c6">the elderly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in </span><span class="c0 c22">managing chronic conditions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;while promoting independence and reducing feelings of loneliness. These innovations, </span><span class="c0 c3">coupled with</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;robust social welfare systems, ensure that older individuals can </span><span class="c0 c11">lead lives that are both dignified and fulfilling</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p><p class="c12 c23"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">In conclusion, although aging </span><span class="c0 c22">presents inherent difficulties</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;such as </span><span class="c0 c6">physical decline and reduced independence</span><span class="c0">, modern advancements in healthcare and technology have </span><span class="c0 c3">considerably mitigated these challenges</span><span class="c0">. As a result, I believe the aging process is </span><span class="c0 c11">far less burdensome in contemporary society</span><span class="c0">, offering individuals greater opportunities to enjoy their later years </span><span class="c0 c17">with comfort and purpose</span><span class="c4 c0">.</span></p></body></html>
